# BB Chess
Bitboard based Chess Engine following the Code Monkey tutorials on YouTube. This project is for learning purposes on chess programming, and will serve as a starting point for developing a non-monolothic chess engine project.

I will  be following all the videos and tutorials step by step and creating C-stylized documentation for each and every function and/or variable so everything is more clear to me and hopefully to anyone who reads and takes a look at my repo.
